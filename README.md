# Design proposal of hotspot setup
The main scope of this project is to set up a hotspot in a coffee shop , which can be accessed by customers and staff . 
This wifi will have multiple access points because customers and staff will be able to access only certain pages whereas admin can access all the pages without any restriction.
This Mini project is done in Cisco packet tracer.
